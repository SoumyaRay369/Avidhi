We need to make them remember the gifts of the financial market and how “Shylok coming for his pound of flesh” is not really a bad thing and that advanced financial markets, in fact, increase the access to credit for the common man. We understand that in most of the developed world it is mostly about increased regulation and redundant bureaucracy(as is the case for Europe which has been perfectly depicted in the document: “Future of European Competitiveness”, put forward in the EU Parliament by Mario Draghi) than it is about realising the merits of capitalism and the globalization. 
                Which is the reason why we are starting our operations from India, a new age democracy; a country where democracy has been there from day one, resulting in friction between the attitude of the working class towards new corporations and the relative size of the economy, coupled with a useless opposition party that solely believes in socialism for vote-bank politics and has in fact included the word “socialist” in the constitution by invoking a state of unnecessary Emergency. We need to counter that narrative as soon as possible before things go out of hand and protect the Indian people from the grips of socialism, where only a few bureaucrats and their owners, ie, politicians, control the nation. </p>
