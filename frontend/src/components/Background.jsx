After enjoying the fruits of capitalism throughout the past century, the world has become quite complacent and the communists and socialists have now risen to propagate their heinous agenda. Rational-minded people need to stop staying mute and raise their voices and callout every situation when either the government is promoting socialism in the name of "protecting" the "common man" or when the anti-social elements are trying to poison the minds of the unsuspecting, ignorant who has grown to blindly believe in whatever the government machinery feeds them.</p>
